= DESCRIPTION

Nagios::Objects -- class for parsing Nagios' objects.cache
file. Objects.cache file keeps information about lists of objects
being monitored by Nagios. It is created by Nagios process on
(re)start. Since it is machine-generated file syntax should not vary
from file to file.

Class implements 2 methods at the time of writing:
* constructor - that only creates an instance and
* parse method - that does actual parsing and populates instance variable @objects

= SYNOPSIS

  require 'nagios/objects'
 
   nagios = Nagios::Objects.new("test/objects.cache").new.parse
   print nagios.objects[:contactgroup]

== Files

Location of objects.cache file depends on Nagios configuration (in
many cases varies from one UNIX/Linux ditribution to another) and is
defined by directive in nagios.cfg file. 

On Debian system objects.cache it is in
/var/cache/nagios3/objects.cache:

  object_cache_file=/var/cache/nagios3/objects.cache

== Parsed data hash

=begin rdoc    

Read objects.cache file and parse it.

Method reads file by blocks. Each block defines one object, definition
starts with 'define <type> {' and ends with '}'. Each block has a
'<type>_name' line which defines name of the instance of the
object. 

Code of the 'parse()' method assumes, that _name line is always first
in the block! This can be not always the case.

Example of a block:

  define contactgroup {
          contactgroup_name       admins
          alias   Nagios Administrators
          members root
          }

Example of a parsed object:

    nagios.objects[:contactgroup]
    => {"admins"=>{:contactgroup_name=>"admins", :alias=>"Nagios Administrators", :members=>"root"}}

    nagios.contactgroup
    => {"admins"=>{:contactgroup_name=>"admins", :alias=>"Nagios Administrators", :members=>"root"}}

=== Convenience methods

Method parse creates helper methods for every type of object after
parsing. Same property can be accessed either using Hash @objects
(i.e. nagios.objects[:host]) or convenience method: nagios.host.
